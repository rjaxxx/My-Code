    <h1>My First Website!</h1>
    <h2>
      Kia ora and Welcome! <span>&mdash; This site was made by Rory Collins</span>
    </h2>
    <div>
      <h3>Why I'm doing this:</h3>  

      <p>&bull; To test my HTML and CSS</p>
      <p>&bull; To practice my designs</p>
      <p>&bull; To learn more</p>
      <p>&bull; To experiment with the topic</p>
      <p>&bull; And for fun :)</p>

    </div>

      <h3>What this site is used for?</h3>

      <p>Nothing important! At this stage at least. For now this will just be a way to test my designs using HTML and CSS for my computer science and software engineering class.
      </p>
      <p>For now, please enjoy browsing this extremely unfinished and work in progress website!</p>
